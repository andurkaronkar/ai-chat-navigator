# AI Chat Navigator

> **Why I Built This**: I found similar extensions online, but they didn't work the way I wanted. Most were clunky, had poor detection, or cluttered the interface. So I decided to create my own clean, efficient solution.

A Chrome extension that works across **all major AI chat platforms**. It automatically extracts and lists your prompts in chronological order (#1, #2, #3...), letting you instantly jump to any part of your conversations.
